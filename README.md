## 🤖 ERC-7857 Agentic iNFT — How MediVault Uses It

ERC-7857 is 0G Labs' flagship standard for Intelligent NFTs with private encrypted metadata. MediVault is the **first healthcare application** of ERC-7857:

| ERC-7857 Feature | MediVault Healthcare Use |
|---|---|
| **`dataHash`** — encrypted metadata hash | Keccak256 of your AES-256 encrypted health record set on 0G Storage |
| **`sealedKey`** — key sealed to owner pubkey | Your AES-256 vault key encrypted with your wallet's ECIES public key. Stored on-chain. |
| **`oracle`** — TEE/ZKP proof verifier | MediVault oracle verifies re-encryption proofs (TEE-backed, bypassable in demo) |
| **`authorizeUsage()`** — grant access without transfer | Patient grants doctor wallet access with a new `sealedKey` scoped to their pubkey — no ownership change |
| **`revokeUsage()`** — revoke access | Patient instantly revokes a doctor's decryption key on-chain |
| **`clone()`** — wallet migration | Patient migrates vault to new wallet with oracle-verified re-encryption |
| **`transfer()`** — oracle-verified ownership transfer | Full wallet transfer with TEE/ZKP proof of correct metadata re-encryption |

```solidity
// Grant a doctor access to your vault (no ownership transfer)
mediVaultRegistry.authorizeUsage(
    tokenId,
    doctorWallet,
    abi.encode(sealedKeyForDoctor, expiry, recordScope)
);

// Doctor retrieves their sealed key
bytes memory permissions = mediVaultRegistry.getExecutorPermissions(tokenId, doctorWallet);
(bytes memory sealedKey, uint256 expiry, bytes32[] memory scope) = abi.decode(permissions, (bytes, uint256, bytes32[]));
// Doctor decrypts with their private key → reads shared records
```

## 🚨 The Problem

Medical records are the most important documents a person owns — yet they're the worst managed.

| Pain point | Reality today |
|---|---|
| 📂 **Scattered** | Spread across clinic portals, PDFs, emails, and paper printouts |
| 😵 **Confusing** | Written in dense medical jargon most patients can't parse |
| 😰 **Risky to store** | Uploading to Google Drive or a random app means trusting a company forever |
| 🚫 **Unshareable** | No secure, instant way to hand a record to a new doctor |
| 🔓 **Owned by others** | Hospitals and labs hold your data — you just get access when they feel like it |

> *Every year, patients arrive at emergency rooms unable to recall their medications, allergies, or prior diagnoses — because their records are scattered across systems they don't control.*

---

## ✅ The Solution

MediVault is a **self-sovereign health vault**. Connect your MetaMask wallet — that's your identity, your key, your vault.

> 💡 **Unlike generic document tools or clinical scribes — MediVault is 100% patient-owned. No doctor, no hospital, no company can access your records. Only your wallet key decrypts them — unless you explicitly call `authorizeUsage()` to grant access.**

```
  Upload any document  →  AI explains it in plain language
         →  AES-256 encrypted in your browser
                 →  Stored on 0G Network permanently
                         →  ERC-7857 iNFT minted — yours forever
```

### How it works in 5 steps

| Step | Action | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1️⃣ | **Connect wallet** | MetaMask signs a fixed message → MediVault derives a deterministic AES-256 key **in your browser**. The key never leaves your device. |
| 2️⃣ | **Upload a document** | Drop any PDF, image, or lab report. `pdf-parse` + `tesseract.js` OCR handles all formats client-side. |
| 3️⃣ | **AI explains it** | 0G Compute returns a plain-language summary, extracts conditions / medications / allergies / red flags, and flags anything urgent. |
| 4️⃣ | **Encrypt & store** | AES-256 ciphertext uploaded to 0G Storage. Merkle root hash indexed in 0G-KV. Your server **never** sees plaintext. |
| 5️⃣ | **Mint ERC-7857 iNFT** | `MediVaultRegistry` mints an Agentic iNFT — `dataHash` anchors your encrypted vault, `sealedKey` stores your vault key on-chain, sealed to your wallet pubkey. |

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Privacy & Encryption

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Wallet-native identity** | Connect MetaMask → AES-256 key derived in-browser from wallet signature. Zero passwords. Zero email. Zero accounts. |
| **Client-side AES-256 encryption** | Every file is encrypted in your browser before upload. 0G Storage only ever receives ciphertext — the server has zero knowledge of your health data. |
| **ERC-7857 sealedKey on-chain** | Your vault's AES-256 key is sealed to your ECIES public key and stored in the iNFT — you can always recover it from your wallet. |
| **ECIES doctor sharing** | Share any record to a doctor's wallet address with Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption. Only the recipient's private key can open it — zero server relay. |
| **`authorizeUsage()` doctor access** | Grant a doctor on-chain access via ERC-7857. Their sealed key is scoped to specific records and an expiry. Revokable instantly. |
| **No recovery by design** | Your wallet = your vault. No backdoor, no admin override. This is a feature, not a bug. |
| **Rate-limited APIs** | Hybrid in-process + KV-backed rate limiter on all public endpoints to prevent abuse. |

### 🧠 AI-Powered Understanding

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Plain-language summaries** | Dense lab panels and discharge summaries decoded into clear, human-readable explanations via 0G Compute — never a centralised cloud. |
| **Smart extraction** | Automatically extracts **conditions**, **medications**, **allergies**, **dosages**, and **red flags** from every uploaded document. |
| **Urgency flagging** | AI highlights anything that needs immediate attention — abnormal lab values, drug interactions, critical findings. |
| **"Explain like I'm 5" toggle** | Switch any summary to the simplest possible explanation. Great for patients without medical backgrounds. |
| **Multi-language support** | AI summaries available in multiple languages — your health data explained in the language you understand. |
| **Vault-wide AI chat** | Ask questions across your entire record history. "What medications have I been prescribed?" — AI cites the exact source document. |

### 📂 Record Management

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Multi-format support** | PDFs, images (JPG/PNG), scanned prescriptions, lab reports, discharge summaries — all handled with OCR + PDF parsing. |
| **Health timeline** | Chronological view of all your medical events across all uploaded records. See your entire health history at a glance. |
| **Lab trend charts** | Visualize lab values (blood sugar, cholesterol, haemoglobin, etc.) over time with reference range overlays. |
| **Content-address deduplication** | Re-upload the same document and MediVault recognises it by content hash — auto-merges, no duplicates, no wasted 0G storage. |
| **Tamper-proof integrity** | Every record has a Merkle root hash verifiable against 0G at any time. One click proves your record is unaltered. |
| **Vault index on-chain** | Record index anchored to 0G-KV — your entire vault can be rebuilt trustlessly from on-chain state. No server required. |

### 👩‍⚕️ Sharing & Collaboration

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Emergency QR card** | One-tap QR with blood type, allergies, and critical medications — scannable by any doctor, saveable to your phone lock screen. |
| **Doctor handoff summary** | One-click printable summary of your entire medical history — structured for healthcare providers, ready for any appointment. |
| **Tamper-proof certificates** | Generate a shareable certificate proving a record exists, is unaltered, and is anchored to 0G — verifiable by anyone, no account needed. |
| **Consent ledger** | Every share event is written to an immutable, hash-chained audit trail on 0G — who accessed what, and when. Forever. |
| **Received records inbox** | Doctors and family members can send ECIES-encrypted records directly to your wallet. Delivered to your received tab. |

### 🔍 Verification

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Root hash verifier** | Visit `/verify` → enter any record root hash → 4 live checks against 0G Network: chain live, file found, hash valid, explorer link. |
| **On-chain vault proof** | `MediVaultRegistry.getVaultByAddress(wallet)` returns root hash, record count, timestamps — verifiable by anyone. |
| **ERC-7857 agent data** | `MediVaultRegistry.getAgentData(tokenId)` returns `dataHash`, `sealedKey`, `oracle` — full iNFT metadata on-chain. |
| **Selective disclosure proofs** | Share cryptographic proof of a single field (e.g. "I am vaccinated") without revealing the full record. Verifiable by anyone at `/verify`. |
| **0G Health endpoint** | `GET /api/og/health` — live JSON showing 0G chain block, storage node count, indexer status. |

### 📲 Mobile & Offline

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **PWA — install from browser** | Add MediVault to your home screen on iOS or Android directly from the browser. No app store. Instant install. |
| **Offline access** | Service worker caches the app shell. Previously viewed records accessible from local encrypted cache even without internet. |

## 🔑 Why 0G — Not IPFS, Not S3, Not Anything Else

Every feature in MediVault depends on a specific 0G primitive. **Remove 0G and the product cannot exist.**

| What MediVault needs | 0G primitive | Without 0G |
|---|---|---|
| Permanent, censorship-resistant encrypted storage | **0G Storage** — AES-256 ciphertext + Merkle root | No vault — nowhere to store ciphertext |
| Decentralised AI inference (no cloud snooping) | **0G Compute** — OpenAI-compatible, TEE-backed | No AI summaries without trusting a centralised API |
| Tamper-proof record index per wallet | **0G-KV** — key-value store keyed by wallet address | No trustless vault rebuild across devices |
| Immutable consent + share audit trail | **0G Chain** — on-chain event log | No verifiable proof of who accessed what |
| Agentic iNFT with private encrypted metadata | **ERC-7857 + MediVaultRegistry** on 0G Mainnet | No Agentic ID — no on-chain sealed key recovery |

## 🛡️ Security Model

```
Your wallet private key
        │
        ▼
  sign(fixedMessage)  ──→  AES-256 key  ──→  encrypts every record
                                │
                     ECIES-sealed to wallet pubkey
                                │
                     stored on-chain in ERC-7857 sealedKey
                                │
                     NEVER recoverable without your wallet
```

| Property | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| **Zero-knowledge server** | API routes process only ciphertext. Plaintext never touches the backend. |
| **No recovery by design** | Lose your wallet → lose your vault. No admin backdoor. This is the point. |
| **ERC-7857 sealedKey** | Your AES-256 key is sealed on-chain. Recoverable only by your wallet — not by MediVault, not by 0G, not by anyone. |
| **Doctor access via oracle** | `authorizeUsage()` grants a new sealed key scoped to one doctor's pubkey. Revokable instantly with `revokeUsage()`. |
| **ECIES sharing** | `ethers.SigningKey.computePublicKey` + SDK ECIES header. Only the recipient's private key decrypts. |
| **Merkle root verification** | Every record hash verifiable on-chain. Tampering is cryptographically impossible. |
| **Soul-bound iNFT** | Standard ERC-721 transfers blocked. Only ERC-7857 `transfer()` with oracle proof allowed. |
